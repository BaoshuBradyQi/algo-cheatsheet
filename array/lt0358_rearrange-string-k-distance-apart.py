"""
maintain a 'waitlist' for char that should be k distance apart
using heap to track put the most desired char first

time complexity: O(slogn), for maintaining the heap size of n, s times
space complexity: O(n), n keys
presumably n is constant number, so the result is O(s) and O(1)

possible improvement: check if there's a valid return first
